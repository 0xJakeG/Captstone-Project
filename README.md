Two ways to interact with our web application.
Local web server:

Step 1: Download dependencies
npm i express morgan mysql body-parser bcrypt express-session cookieparser express-mysql-session
Step 2: Fund the packages
npm fund
Step 3: Start the web server
npm start
Step 4: Go to browser and navigate to:
http//localhost:8080
Notes:
On the local server, the login works for the first time. If you log out and back in, you need to refresh the page to view the information. On the deployed server, it works as intended. Still unsure why local behaves differently.
